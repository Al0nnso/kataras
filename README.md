He is a self-taught developer with 12+ years of experience who loves talking to people, cooking and programming languages, not exactly in that order.

At the same time, Gerasimos is studying at the Department of Computer, Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering of the [International Hellenic University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/international-hellenic-university/).
