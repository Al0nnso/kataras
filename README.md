He is a self-taught developer with 12+ years of experience who loves talking to people, cooking and programming languages, not exactly in that order. He has contributed to various open-source projects. Passionate creator of the [Iris Web Framework](https://iris-go.com/testimonials/). At the same time, Gerasimos is studying at the Department of Computer, Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering of the [International Hellenic University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/international-hellenic-university/).

Five years ago he fell in love with the [Go programming language](https://golang.org), and since then he hasn't cheated on for any other. Regularly advices startups and individuals on the latest web technologies.

He shares his experience with people around the world through https://dev.to/kataras and https://medium.com/@kataras. And, like (almost) every developer, he really enjoys a hot cup of ☕️!

He is always available for you...
